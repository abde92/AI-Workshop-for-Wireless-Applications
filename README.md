# AI Workshop for Wireless Applications 

## Agenda

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a critical component of many engineering systems and disciplines today. In the field of Wireless, AI is being used to design and develop smarter ways to model physical layers, optimize performance of wireless systems and networks and address new 6G design challenges .

In this hands-on workshop you will write and run code entirely in the browser using MATLAB&reg; Online&trade;. You will learn how to apply principles of AI (machine learning, deep learning, domain-specific processing) to Wireless Communication workflows.

This interactive hands-on session will include the following:

* Familiarize yourself with with MATLAB Online and AI tools.
* Create and evaluate necessary components to succeed in AI modeling , by implementing an example of Modulation Classification
* Deep dive into an advanced, domain-specific application that showcases a complete workflow for accomplishing 5G Channel Estimation

MathWorks instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) will be available throughout the session to guide you. If the event is being held onsite, please bring your laptop and install the Google Chrome browser beforehand.
